路 Node.js is a js runtime, uses the v8 engine and is used for developing server-side and networking apps/apis

路 nodejs is non-blocking, that is, doesn't wait for i/o operation to complete and instead using asynchronous paradigms, it allows 
  it to continue the program's execution while the i/o is fetched/transmitted. This is called an event loop 

路 Since nodejs is single-threaded(event loop) it isn't suitable for CPU intensive operations 

路 The global object is called "global" instead of "window", the DOM doesn't exist but we have process which represents the current 
  process being run
